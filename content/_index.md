Hi, I'm Jared

I've wandered through a few fields - engineering, data, product, leadership - and the thread in common has been finding the puzzle and working it with people who care about it.

I cut through messy problems, spot patterns, and build things that end up being useful and reliable. Sometimes that's a data system, sometimes it's a product, sometimes it's just pulling right group of people together.

I thrive in spaces between traditional roles - switching hats comes naturally to me. The fun part (for me) is mixing engineering, product sense, and design instincts to make things that people want.

This same approach shapes how I tackle everything - cooking a new recipe (and modifying it on the fly), finding a new board game strategy, or spending an evening with some paint - I like puzzles in all their forms.

This site is a place for me to share my ideas, experiments, and works-in-progress.
